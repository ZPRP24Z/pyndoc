![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ZPRP24Z/pyndoc)

*Pyndoc* will be a CLI for conversion of markup languages, functioning effectively as an alternative to [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc). The application will be compatible with Pandoc's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The primary goal of the project is to make the CLI easily extensible in terms of new formats.

For development use see [startup instructions](https://github.com/ZPRP24Z/pyndoc/blob/main/docs/startup_instructions.md)

## Documentation

Currently, the project uses the Github Wiki for storing documentation, see the [Home](https://github.com/ZPRP24Z/pyndoc/wiki) page for details. In later stages of development, there are plans to switch to Github Pages.
